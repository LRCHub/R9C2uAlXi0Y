An ordinary life, an ordinary day
I never knew it any other way
The time fades away like the night into the day
Another hour lost, another bill to pay
The morning washes over me
Circling towards the drain
I try to keep going, ignoring the pain
Looking down at myself
Staring fear in the face
And in the rippling water
I'm being taken from this

Inner disaster, growing faster in my mind
I am drifting
(Thoughts and memories drift away)
Weigh your future, bury your past
The time will come when the first are last

This present moment, reality so unreal
Functionality fading
Don't understand what I feel
Where is this going?
Can't recall myself
No regard for my life, no regard for my health
Myself to the left, the world to the right
I'm not quite ready to give up this fight
No sense of control, almost like possession
Distorted consciousness, precious regression

What is this I feel taking over me?
I'm now somewhere else momentarily
Where am I? Is this real?
Losing touch with myself

It grips my being and I cannot speak
Its powerful release leaves me weak
In silent euphoria, deafening bliss
Captivated by magnificence
I witness my insignificance
Everything fades, everything fades

Inner disaster, growing faster in my mind
I am drifting
(Thoughts and memories drift away)
Weigh your future, bury your past
The time will come when the first are last
