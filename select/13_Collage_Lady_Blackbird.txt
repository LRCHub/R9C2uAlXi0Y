Blue for the blue I feel
When I'm feelin' down
On the ground feelin' down
That could be most any day

Green for the eyes, they can look around
When the sun goes down
And the sun goes down in the strangest way

Red for the ride
Gotta stop this thing, got a song to sing
That is everything that I meant to say
I meant to say

Green for the minds on a trial
Like the world never see the good
Well it's done, the battle's too late to see

Two of us make is easier
To read the signs
Memorise the lines
Won't you say with me?

One for the road
I'll be on my way
Come another day
When the things we say
Find a way to be
A way to be

I'm living with this
I'm living with this
Song to sing and it's
I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm living with this

Out on call for a change of year
Bringin' winter near
Where springs are brown and the skies are bright

Winter time is ready to be
Where the devil made this the price to pay
For the summer time

Oh 'til the sun goes down, and the sun goes
Oh 'til the sun goes down, and the sun goes
Oh 'til the sun goes down, and the sun goes
Oh 'til the sun goes down, and the sun goes
Oh 'til the sun goes down, and the sun goes
Sun goes down, and the sun goes
Sun goes down, and the sun goes
Sun goes down, and the sun goes
Sun goes down, and the sun goes

Sun goes down, and the sun goes
Sun goes down, and the sun goes
Sun goes down, and the sun goes

Blue for the blue I feel
When I'm feelin' down
On the ground feelin' down
That could be most any day

Green for the eyes, they can look around
When the sun goes down
And the sun goes down in the strangest way

Red for the ride
Gotta stop this thing, got a song to sing
That is everything that I meant to say
I meant to say

One for the road
I'll be on my way
Come another day
When the things we say
Find a way to be

I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm living with this
Song to sing and it's

I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm living with this
Song to sing and it's

I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm living with this
Song to sing and it's

I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm living with this
Song to sing and it's

I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm living with this
I'm liv-
