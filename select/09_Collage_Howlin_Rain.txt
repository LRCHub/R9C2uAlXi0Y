Blue for the blue I feel when I'm feelin' down on the ground
Feelin' down
That could be most any day
Green for the eyes, take look around
When the sun goes down and the sun goes down
In the strangest way
Red for the light, got to stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say
Meant to say

Three for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done, just the bad
It's too late to see
Two of us make it easier to read the signs
Memorize the lines
Will you play with me?
One for the road, I'll be on my way
Come another day, when the things we say
Find a way to be
Way to be

Autumn calls for a change of year, bringing winter near us
Green to brown and the sky's a sign
Wintertime is a razor blade that the devil made
It's the price we pay for the summertime
Spring days come, it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from, where the children go
It's a nursery rhyme
Nursery rhyme
