Blue for the blue I feel
When I'm feelin down on the ground, feelin' down
That could be most any day

Green for the eyes, take a look around
When the sun goes down and the sun goes down
In the strangest way

Red for the light, got to stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything that I meant to say
Meant to say

Three for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done, just the bad
It's too late to see

Two of us make it easier
To read the signs, memorize the lines
Will you play with me?

One for the road, I'll be on my way
Come another day, when the things we say find a way to be
Way to be

Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringing winter near us, green to brown
And the sky's a sign

Wintertime is a razor blade
That the devil made, it's the price we pay
For the summertime

Spring days come, it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from, where the children go
It's a nursery rhyme
Nursery rhyme
